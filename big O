O(1) find x in 1 attempt

O(log n) find x from list by splitting list in halves recursively

O(n) find x by iterating through each item in list

O(n log n) find x by iterating through each item in list, then iterate again by splitting list in halves recursively

O(n^2) find x by iterating through list twice
