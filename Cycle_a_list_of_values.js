// You're part of a team porting MS Paint into the browser and currently working on a new UI component that allows user to control the canvas zoom level.

// According to the wireframes delivered to you in PowerPoint format the user should be able to cycle through specified zoom levels by clicking a button in the UI repeatedly. The reverse direction should work with shift key held.

// A new function is needed to support this behavior, so you alt-tab to Visual Studio and get to work.
